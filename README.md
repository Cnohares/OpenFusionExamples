## Introduction

This is a Repo of several open source stuff about [Clickteam Fusion](https://www.clickteam.com/).

## How to Contribute

If you have some good examples or something else and want to share, just simply fork this repo, then put files in a folder named by your works, place this folder by it's type, e.g. shaders in shaders folder, add a explanation to this file (ReadMe.md, alphabetically), and feel free to send a PR.

## Folders

### Extensions

- Deque2D
  - *Created by Defisym.*

  - *Created by Defisym.*
  - *Finally here comes the gauss blur shader for DX11*
  - *GaussBlur2D is very slow, use GaussBlur instead, or two GaussBlur1D for X/Y blur*

small tools

  - *Created by CallofAS.*
  - *a handy tool bar set*

- DX11 Shader Compile Tool
  - *Created by Defisym.*

- JDK Terminator
  - *Created by Defisym.*
  - *Fusion will use JDK to build Android applications, but unfortunately, sometimes JDK process will not terminate correctly even you quit fusion. If you are using steam version, steam will think fusion is still running and refuse to restart fusion or steam itself, unless you terminate the process manually in task manager, which is annoying. This script can help you terminate it with a single click.*

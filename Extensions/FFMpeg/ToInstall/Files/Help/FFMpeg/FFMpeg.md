# FFMpeg

## Description

FFMpeg Player

**NOTE:** this object requires FFMpeg & SDL

FFMpeg: you need to download release (e.g., `ffmpeg-n5.0-latest-win32-lgpl-shared-5.0.zip` ) from <https://github.com/sudo-nautilus/FFmpeg-Builds-Win32/releases>, then put dlls into Fusion root & `Runtime/Unicode`, or you need to build X86 version from FFMpeg source code, as the official 32 bit support has stopped.

SDL: you need to download `SDL2-2.24.0-win32-x86.zip` from <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases>, then put X86 dlls into Fusion root & `Runtime/Unicode`
